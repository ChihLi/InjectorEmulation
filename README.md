# InjectorEmulation
The codes implement the method: [An efficient surrogate model for emulation and physics extraction of large eddy simulations (2018)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.2017.1409123) proposed by Mak, Sung, Yeh, Wang, Chang, Joseph, Yang, and Wu, which is published in _Journal of the American Statistical Association_.

To reproduce Figures 6 and 7, and the corresponding values for Figure 8 in the paper, run the file `example2.R`. The R package `InjectorEmulationHelper` needs to be installed from the source package file `InjectorEmulationHelper.tar.gz`. The reproduced results for Figure 6 and 7 are outputted to the directories `output2/POD_expansion/6` and `output2/validation/comparison`, while the results for Figure 8 are printed on the console.  

Because the full simulation data is too large to accompany the manuscript, we have provided a simple example in `example1.R` which uses a simulated toy data to illustrate the full emulation procedure. The raw data can be changed by following the same format in the directory `data1/rawdata folder`: first three columns correspond to the x-, y- and z-coordinates, and other columns are the responses. The experimental design can also be changed from the file `data1/DoE.csv`. The geometry design and raw data for testing validation cases can also be modified in the file “data1/newX.csv” and the folder `data1/testdata`.
